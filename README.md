# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page

![Design preview for the Base Apparel coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

It required a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The landing page is mobile repsonsive while using javascript for the use of the email validation form.
